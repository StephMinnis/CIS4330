# Installing Docker

### Installation Process
I installed docker from the website https://www.docker.com/ . 
Since I am on a windows computer I had to install WSL for docker to work. A problem that I ran into was I had to change my system information to allow
Virtualization. I had trouble accessing my bios but I finally figured out to just go into the windows start up setting and fix the problem to show bios when restarted.
When I was in the bios I enabled Virtualization. Then after that my docker worked. And I was presented with this page.
