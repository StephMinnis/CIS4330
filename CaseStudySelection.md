# Option #5:  Present a case study on Netflix Prana: Prana: A Sidecar for your Netflix PaaS based Applications and Services
### Case Study Selection - Stephanie Minnis - CIS4330

I am want to pick this case because I want to learn more at the architecture of Netflix. And how it can be used for other applications and programs. 
I really enjoying the netflix platform and how it's so responsive and fast to use, considering it offers thousands of videos 
on it's platform. So it would be interesting to learn about how one would re-create such application and how the architecture of it is done.
I hope to do this case study topic because I am curious about how one builds the service using microservices.
