# Blogpost 1 - Microservice Gartner Report Thoughts
Many companies and businesses are adopting a microservice framework in their software's architecture. 
Big companies such as Netflix, Twitter, Soundcloud, and Spotify use microservice architecture. 
The major point of microservices is the fact that each part is independently built, which enables you to also test, package and deploy independently as well.
A goal of microservices is how it improves the community development with a program because it is very agile.
A microservice is not reusable, and it does not need to have a REST API. 
The architectue is still in the early stages of adoption and many companies trying to incorporate microservices fail or struggle with adapting because they aren't willing to fully follow the practices for successfully incorportating and useing the microservices. 
The company has to be prepared to use unfamiliar designs and practices and different automation experience. 

#### Granularity

Mircoservice- To enable continuous delivery
Miniservice- To improve application agility while avoiding some of the more disruptive
Macroservice- To enable access to functionality within a monolithic application
